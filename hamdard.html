    <p> Pakistan has one of the lowest HDI's in Asia, with almost 15% of the population still living under the absolute
    poverty line. Wealth is disproportionately distributed among the top 10%, which ultimately means that the bottom 30% can
    only earn about 4.1% of the income. The upper and middle classes then have the responsibility to help these people in
    whatever way they can.</p>
    <p>This is where Project Hamdard comes in. Project Hamdard is exactly as the name might suggest, it aims at philanthropy
    for the underprivileged. Globally, absolute poverty is at a sharp decline. But, in a capitalist structure, relative poverty
    continues to prey on a significant majority of the world population. Recognizing our privilege is the first step in
    ameliorating these statistics to the best of our capabilities. Project Hamdard plans to organize food, books, and clothes
    drives where the financially deterred can have access to these facilities. Given the current pandemic, it will also work
    towards the distribution of Personal Protective Equipment. In the future, as it gains more momentum, we will work at placing
    donation boxes at various institutes across the country to help garner funds for the project. In cases of emergencies, our
    contact number will be readily provided.</p>
