    <p> Every time I look outside all I see is an inevitable destruction slowing coming our way. Earth is no longer a garden
    of Eden.in fact, it is fast racing towards deterioration and death. With atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels at a dangerous
    high,flooding sea waters, and massive carbon footprints corroding our land, it is essential that major and immediate actions
    come into existence.</p>
    <p> While profit-oriented corporations are the ones to actually be heald accountable, it is individuals that hand them the
    profit, and thereofore, the power to continue preying on the planet. Every change starts with an individual. Speak up for
    this nation, we are the ones who have to be the gardeners of our foreseeing garden of Eden. We are the beacon of hope
    which has the power to restore Earth to its once pristine state.</p>
