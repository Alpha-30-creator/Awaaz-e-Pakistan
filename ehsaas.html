    <p> Crime runs rampant everywhere around us, and  more often than not the legal system fails its people. Justice is for those
      gender and class favors; the rest msut find their salvation in silence. In times like these, the call out culture on social
      media becomes all the more imperative, as it is a place relatively free of discrimination.</p>
    <p>Project Ehsaas is geared towards empathy. It works to provide a safe space for victims of harassment, be it sexual or cyber,
      to have a safe space for their experiences. At times where lockdowns are resulting in a sharp spike in cases of domestic
      violence, sexual assault, and online bullying, it is imperative that no plea go unheard. This subset of Awaaz e Pakistan
      directs these individuals towards the comfort to narrate their stories in a manner devoid of scrutiny or judgement, and
      connect them with professional help so they may get more constructive help. While we will always be there to support, listen
      and provide any necessary help, we are NOT an alternative to therapy.</p>
